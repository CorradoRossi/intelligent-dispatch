1. React Frontend:
   - App.js: Main component and routing
   - Dashboard.js: Displays daily assignments
   - ServiceRequestForm.js: Creates new service requests
   - TechnicianSchedule.js: Shows technician schedules

2. Flask Backend:
   - app.py: Contains API endpoints and basic matching algorithm
   - Models: Customer, Technician, ServiceRequest, TechnicianAvailability, Assignment

3. PostgreSQL Database:
   - Tables: customers, technicians, service_requests, technician_availability, assignments

Data Flow:
1. User interacts with React components
2. React components make API calls to Flask backend
3. Flask backend processes requests, interacts with the database, and returns responses
4. React components update the UI based on the received data

Key Features:
- Create and retrieve service requests
- Update technician availability
- Assign technicians to service requests based on availability
- Display daily assignments and technician schedules

Note: This MVP focuses on core functionality and lacks advanced features like
complex scheduling algorithms, user authentication, or real-time updates.
